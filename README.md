# Tactile-Navigator-Glove
Tactile Navigator Glove, a wearable assistive device designed for visually impaired users. The glove integrates ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in real-time and provides tactile feedback via vibration motors, along with auditory feedback using a mobile app powered by Google Text-to-Speech (TTS).
This project is a practical example of a Tangible User Interface (TUI)—the glove acts as a physical interface through which users interact with the digital system (sensor data and auditory output). Unlike traditional GUIs, the Tactile Navigator uses touch and motion as primary input and output channels, creating a more natural and accessible user experience.
The glove connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth, and when it detects an obstacle, it sends distance data to the app, which then vocalizes messages like:
“Obstacle detected 30 centimeters ahead.”
This project bridges the physical and digital worlds, enhancing HCI through tangible interaction and providing real-world benefits for accessibility.
